       </h2>

       <!--separated paragraphs with content-->
       <p>I am a student with Thinkful Coding Bootcamp. I am also in pursuit of a computer science degree at San Diego Miramar College. 
       </p>
        <p>I am so excited and grateful to be learning to code in such a fast-paced way. 
          </p>
           <p>The more I learn about computers and their incredible abilities, the more I want to know and practice it. Computers are incredibly impressive!
           </p>
       <p>
         I am married with two children, which keeps me pretty busy most of the time. 
        Some of my other interests, apart from coding, include:
       <!--ordered list, shows up with numbers-->  
       </p>
       <ol>
           <li>playing the guitar</li> 
           <li>snowboarding</li>
           <li> traveling </li> 
       </ol>
      
         <p>
           I could play guitar for hours and not realize the time flying by. I love making music and practicing to commit new songs to memory. My brother taught me to snowboard at about 10 years old and I have been hooked ever since. There's nothing like cold mountain air blasting in your face as you fly down a hill. As for traveling, I believe it is so important to see new places and delve into different cultures as much as possible.
